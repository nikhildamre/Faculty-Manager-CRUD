This is a Flutter-based Android app that performs **CRUD operations** on a mock faculty database using **Mockoon** as the backend API. It satisfies all requirements outlined in the Getfly Technologies internship assignment.

## Project Structure

lib/
- models/
  - faculty_model.dart       # Faculty data model
- services/
  - api_service.dart         # Handles API requests (GET, POST)
- screens/
  - home_screen.dart         # Lists all faculty entries
  - add_faculty_screen.dart  # Add new faculty via form
  - edit_faculty_screen.dart # Edit existing faculty
- main.dart                  # App entry point

## 🔧 State Management Approach

- Used **`setState()`** for updating the UI after Create/Delete operations.
- New faculty are added to a local list in memory and displayed without relying on persistent backend updates (due to mock API limitations).
- The list updates immediately after submission via `Navigator.pop(context, newFaculty)` and `setState()`.

## 🧪 Mock API Setup

We use **Mockoon CLI** to simulate backend behavior.

### 🔧 Step-by-Step

1. Install Mockoon CLI:
   ```bash
   npm install -g @mockoon/cli

2. Place trial.json at the root of your project:
faculty_manager/
├─ lib/
├─ android/
├─ trial.json   👈 Place it here
└─ ...

3. Start the mock server:(if not there)
mockoon-cli start --data "./trial.json" --port 3001

4.The API base URL used in code:
http://localhost:3001/faculty
